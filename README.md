# Nikola DackoviÄ‡ - Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is a showcase of my frontend development journey and the skills I have gained while learning and building projects in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

The goal of this portfolio is to present my work in a clean and structured way, making it easy for visitors to explore my projects, learn about my skills, and get in touch with me. It reflects my approach to frontend development: attention to detail, responsive design, and practical functionality.  

## Whatâ€™s included
- **About Me** â€“ a section that highlights my background, experience, and passion for web development.  
- **Projects** â€“ a collection of projects I have built during my learning process, including live demos and links to GitHub repositories. Each project demonstrates different skills, from DOM manipulation and JavaScript logic to responsive layouts and interactive UI.  
- **Contact** â€“ a section for anyone to reach out for collaboration, feedback, or professional opportunities.  

This portfolio also demonstrates my understanding of:  
- **HTML5** for semantic markup and accessibility  
- **CSS3** including Flexbox, Grid, and animations  
- **JavaScript** for interactivity, DOM manipulation, and basic logic  
- **Responsive Design** to ensure the website looks good on all devices  

By building this portfolio, I aimed to create a personal space where I can not only showcase my projects but also document my growth as a frontend developer. It serves as a live example of my coding skills, design sense, and ability to organize and present information effectively.
